# About Project
The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation system that recommends movies to users. This python project is designed to help you understand the functioning of how a recommendation system works. This project is made in jupyter notebook.

Before moving ahead in this movie recommendation system project in ML, you need to know what recommendation system means. Read below to find the answer.

# What are Recommendation systems?
Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in today’s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.



The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. 


# Uses of Recommendation systems
Recommendations are not a new concept. Even when e-commerce was not that prominent, the sales staff in retail stores recommended items to the customers for the purpose of upselling and cross-selling, and ultimately maximise profit. The aim of recommendation systems is just the same. 
Another objective of the recommendation system is to achieve customer loyalty by providing relevant content and maximising the time spent by a user on your website or channel.

 A movie recommendation system is a filtration program whose prime goal is to recommend a movie to the user which is similar to the movie given by the user.

**Different types of filtration strategies :**

**1). Content-based filtering :** This strategy is based on the data provided about the items. The algorithm recommends products that are similar to one that a user has liked in the past. For example: if a user likes a movie ‘The Prestige’ then we can recommend the movie ‘Christian Bale’ or movies with genre ‘Thriller’.

**2). Collaborative Filtering :** This filtering strategy is based on the combination of user’s behavior and comparing and contrasting that with other user’s behavior in the database. The history of user’s plays an important role in algorithms. The main difference between content-based and collaborative filtering is that in the latter, the interaction of all users with the items influences the recommendation algorithm while for content based concerned user’s data is taken into account.

## **Dataset**
In order to build our recommendation system, we have used the MovieLens Dataset. You can find the movies.csv and ratings.csv file that we have used in our Recommendation System Project [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip)
