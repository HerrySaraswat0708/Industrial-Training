#Movie Recommendation system
###A movie recommendation system is a filtration program whose prime goal is to recommend a movie to the user which is similar to the movie given by the user.
**Different types of filtration strategies :**
**1). Content-based filtering :** This strategy is based on the data provided about the items. The algorithm recommends products that are similar to one that a user has liked in the past. For example: if a user likes a movie ‘The Prestige’ then we can recommend the movie ‘Christian Bale’ or movies with genre ‘Thriller’.
**2). Collaborative Filtering :** This filtering strategy is based on the combination of user’s behavior and comparing and contrasting that with other user’s behavior in the database. The history of user’s plays an important role in algorithms. The main difference between content-based and collaborative filtering is that in the latter, the interaction of all users with the items influences the recommendation algorithm while for content based concerned user’s data is taken into account.
